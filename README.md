# WOPR

I've been working on a command line version of WOPR, which is mentioned in the film WarGames, built with Ruby. This project needs a lot of work and I am happy to receive suggestions for improvement.

## Clone Project

    git clone https://github.com/jacobproffer/wopr.git
    
## Compile

    ruby main.rb
